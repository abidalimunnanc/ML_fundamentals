# ML_fundamentals
All the fundamental ML tools from scratch using python also describing same with scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow
ML Tools including Regression, Classification, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, NLP, ANN, RNN, CNN, Reinforcement learning, GAN etc.
1. Machine learning algorithms are implemented using python and numpy(for matrix operations)
2. Jupyter Notebook for learning each every step, use object oriented program of python
